            <div class="game-text">
Fixed a bug where the wrong affinity or status ailments could be applied to some weapons when performing specific actions.
Fixed a bug where players could bypass being blocked by another player on any platform through unauthorized methods.<p></p>
<h2><mark style="color: #fff0c8; background-color: #c49618;">1.16 Bug fixes:</mark><p></p></h2>
Fixed an issue where temporary boosts to player stats would remain even after closing and restarting the game.
Several other bug fixes.
<p></p>
Possible unstable performance fixes
For the PS5 version of the game, unstable framerate may be improved by using the "Rebuild Database" option from the device's safe mode.
In some PC versions, Ray Tracing may be unintentionally enabled and cause unstable performance. Please check the Ray Tracing setting in the "System" > "Graphics " > "Ray Tracing Quality" from the title screen or in-game menu.<p></p>
In the PC version, the message "Inappropriate activity detected" may appear without cheating.
To fix this issue, please verify the integrity of the game's files before restarting the game.
In the PC version, unstable framerate may be caused by third party applications that control mouse behavior.  Deactivating these third party applications may improve performance.

Outfits
A new feature that will be added to the upcoming update is the addition of Outfits and the ability to be able to change Sekiro's physical appearance. Changing Sekiro's outfit can be done by using the Sculptor's Idol. There are three outfits that will be added which include the "Tengu" outfit, the "Old Ashina Shinobi" outfit, and another which is currently unknown.
Reflections & Gauntlets
Two new modes will be added such as the Reflections and Gauntlets of Strength.<p></p>
Reflections of Strength is a game mode that allows players to challenge any boss for a re-match that has been previously defeated by the player. The Wolf can reflect on these memories and re-run the battle of the selected boss, this allows the player to better understand the boss, to learn its movements, and to come up with various ways to achieve victory.<p>   </p>
Gauntlets of Strength are single-life challenges where players are thrown into a series of battles against various enemies. This is a challenge where players must start a gauntlet and complete it in order to obtain unique rewards such as the new outfits. However, partaking in a gauntlet won't be easy, if by any chance, the player dies at any point in the level of the gauntlet, they will have to start from the beginning.
